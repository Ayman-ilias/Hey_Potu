       HEY POTU POS SYSTEM - EASY SETUP GUIDE
===================================================

FOR SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW TECHNICAL STUFF:
---------------------------------------------

STEP 1: INSTALL DOCKER DESKTOP (ONE TIME ONLY)
   - Download Docker Desktop from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
   - Install it (just click "Next" until it's done)
   - After installation, open Docker Desktop
   - Wait until you see "Docker Desktop is running" at the bottom

STEP 2: START THE POS SYSTEM
   - Just double-click the file: START_HERE.bat
   - Wait 15-20 seconds
   - Your browser will open automatically with the POS system!

STEP 3: USE THE SYSTEM
   - The POS system will open at: http://localhost:1111
   - You can now use it normally!

STEP 4: STOP THE SYSTEM (When done for the day)
   - Double-click the file: STOP_HERE.bat
   - That's it! The system is stopped.

===================================================

MOVING TO ANOTHER COMPUTER:
--------------------------
1. Make sure Docker Desktop is installed on the new computer
2. Copy the ENTIRE "hey" folder to the new computer
3. Double-click START_HERE.bat on the new computer
4. Done! The system will work exactly the same way.

===================================================

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
Problem: "Docker is not running" error
Solution: Open Docker Desktop application first, then try again.

Problem: Browser doesn't open automatically
Solution: Manually open your browser and go to: http://localhost:1111

Problem: Port 1111 is already in use
Solution: Close any other programs using that port, then run STOP_HERE.bat and START_HERE.bat again.

===================================================

IMPORTANT NOTES:
--------------
- DO NOT close Docker Desktop while using the POS system
- DO NOT delete any files in the "hey" folder
- Your data is saved automatically in the "backend" folder
- Keep Docker Desktop running in the background
